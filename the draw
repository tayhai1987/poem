Delusion Angel

-By David Jewell



Daydream delusion.    浸入白日梦中的幻觉

Limousine Eyelash     眨动了密长的睫毛

Oh, baby with your pretty face    噢，亲爱的，滑过你美丽的脸庞

Drop a tear in my wineglass    在我的酒杯里注入一滴清泪

Look at those big eyes     凝视你纯净的双眸

See what you mean to me    了然了你是我生命的意义

Sweet cakes and milkshakes   仿佛奶昔在蛋糕的甜美中交融

I am a delusioned angel     我像那恍惚中浮现的天使

I am a fantasy parade.    在梦幻中游弋飘荡

I want you to know what I think.   怎忍再看你芳心百转

Don't want you to guess anymore.    却如何才能两情相悦

You have no idea where I came from.    不知晓我来自何方

We have no idea where we're going.    更不知哪里才是我们的归宿

Launched in life.     只管拥抱生活

Like branches in the river.   就象溪流终要汇入江河

Flowing downstream.     迤逦而下

Caught in the current.   随波逐流

I'll carry you. You'll carry me.   你中有我，我中有你

hat's how it could be.    本该如此

Don't you know me     可知我心

Don't you know me by now.   终知我心
